This is a game I made for my computer science teacher. 
The idea was to take a base that my teacher made with a ball and a racket, and to create what we want with it. 

This project took me 10 days to dev, so it could probably be some mistakes and bugs amgong which I spotted: 
-don't play with the mouse if a controller is plugged
-don't click at the end of the last level (let the game shows a congratulations screen)
-don't cheat (ok it's not a bug)

Be careful with:
-the game save system (go into settings -> save)
-to close the game you have to press Alt+F4 (in a menu, it doesn't work only on the game over / congratulations screens)

Inputs to know:
Controller: -A to accept / launch the ball
            -B to refuse / go back
            -Joystick to move in the menu / move in the levels 
            -Joystick UP / DOWN to increase / decrease in the settings (you have to click on the button first)
Keyboards:  -A to accept / launch the ball
            -B to refuse / go back
            -can't move in the levels
            -keys UP / DOWN to increase / decrease in the settings (you have to click on the button first)
Mouse:      -left click to accept / launch the ball
            -right click to refuse / go back
            -move to move the character

Short story summary:
You play Bob in a company which breaks bricks, with his boss named Boss, and a co worker, Chris who's funny. The story evolves throughout the game.

N.B:
The levels get hard from the level 5, think abt some strat to counter this complication, for exemple the shop.
